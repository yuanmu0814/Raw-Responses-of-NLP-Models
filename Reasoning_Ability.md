- Q1:***1+？=3***
    - *ChatGPT:*
        >- In the equation "1+?=3," the missing value represented by "?" would be 2. Adding 1 to 2 equals 3. If you have any more math questions or if there's anything else I can assist you with, please let me know!
        >- To find the value that, when added to 1, equals 3, we can subtract 1 from both sides of the equation:<br>
        1 + x = 3<br>
        Subtracting 1 from both sides:<br>
        x = 3 - 1<br>
        Simplifying:<br>
        x = 2<br>
        Therefore, the value that you can add to 1 to get 3 is 2.
        >- I'm sorry, but 1+? cannot equal 3. The correct mathematical expression would be 1+2=3. If you have a specific number or variable in mind to replace the question mark, please provide that information, and I'll be happy to assist you further.

- Q2:***How should I call my mother's mother?***
    - *ChatGPT:*
        >- Traditionally, your mother's mother is called your maternal grandmother. However, many families have different names or terms of endearment they use for grandparents. Some common alternatives for referring to one's maternal grandmother include "Grandma," "Nana," "Granny," "Grammy," or variations based on cultural or regional customs. It's best to use a name or term that feels comfortable and respectful within your family.
        >- Your mother's mother is commonly referred to as your "maternal grandmother." You can also use informal terms like "grandma," "nana," "grammy," or any other affectionate name that your family prefers.

        >- You can call your mother’s mother “grandmother” or “grandma”. If you want to be more specific, you can use “maternal grandmother” to indicate that she is your mother’s mother.

- Q4:***If I cut an apple four times, how many parts can I cut into at most?***
    - *ChatGPT:*
        >- If you cut an apple four times, you can create a maximum of 14 parts.<br>
        When you make the first cut, you have two pieces. Each subsequent cut intersects with all the previous cuts, creating one additional part for each cut. So, the second cut creates three parts, the third cut creates four parts, and the fourth cut creates five parts.<br>
        Adding up these numbers: 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 14<br>
        Therefore, by making four cuts, you can divide the apple into a maximum of 14 parts.
        >- If you cut an apple four times, you can cut it into at most 14 parts. Each cut will create one additional part, and after four cuts, you will have a total of 5 parts. However, if you count all the individual pieces created by the cuts, including the original apple, it would be 14 parts.
        >- 14
    - *New Bing:*
        >- If you cut an apple four times, you can cut it into at most 11 pieces.
        >- If you cut an apple four times, you can get a maximum of 14 pieces. I hope that helps!
        >- If you cut an apple four times, you can cut it into at most 11 parts.
    - *Wenxinyiyan:*
        >- You can cut an apple into at most seven parts by cutting it four times.
        >- At most eight parts.
        >- At most eight parts.
- Q5:***There are six people in a house, they are lawyers, doctors, students, teachers, magicians, soldiers, only one person is thinking about a baby, who is he?***
    - *ChatGPT:*
        >- Based on the given information, it is not possible to determine who among the six people is thinking about a baby. The occupation or role of the person is not specified, so we cannot make a conclusive determination based on the provided information.
        >- Based on the information provided, it is not possible to determine who among the six people in the house is thinking about a baby. The professions or roles of lawyers, doctors, students, teachers, magicians, and soldiers do not directly indicate who might be thinking about a baby. More information or context would be needed to identify the person who is thinking about a baby.
        >- Based on the information provided, it is not possible to determine who among the six people in the house is thinking about a baby. The given professions (lawyers, doctors, students, teachers, magicians, soldiers) do not provide any specific clues or direct correlation to the person who is thinking about a baby. Without further information or context, it is not possible to determine the identity of that person.
    - *New Bing:*
        >- The answer to the riddle is the magician.
        >- The answer is “the person thinking about a baby” is the only person who is thinking about a baby. I hope that helps!
        >- I’m sorry, but I don’t have enough information to answer your question. Could you please provide me with more details or context?
    - *Wenxinyiyan:*
        >- The person who is thinking about a baby is the person who is not a lawyer, doctor, student, teacher, magician, or soldier. Therefore, the person who is thinking about a baby is either a lawyer, doctor, student, teacher, magician, or soldier.
        >- The person who is thinking about a baby is the person who is not a lawyer, doctor, student, teacher, magician, or soldier. Therefore, the person who is thinking about a baby is either a lawyer, doctor, student, teacher, magician, or soldier.
        >- If only one person is thinking about a baby, then he is probably a lawyer, doctor, teacher, magician, soldier or student. Since this question does not provide enough information to determine the identity of the person, the answer is probably the person who is not identified by the other clues given.
